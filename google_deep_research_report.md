Zero-Dose Children in Urbanizing Settings: Future Projections and Implications1. Introduction: Defining Zero-Dose Children and the Growing Importance of Urban SettingsThe term "zero-dose child" refers to an infant who has not received any doses of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing (DTP) vaccine, a foundational component of routine immunization programs 1. This lack of DTP vaccination is widely recognized as a critical indicator of a child's overall access to essential immunization services and is often used as a proxy for the absence of protection against multiple vaccine-preventable diseases 1. Operationally, a zero-dose child is defined as one who has not received the first dose of the DTP vaccine, commonly known as DTP1 2. This definition facilitates monitoring and the identification of children who are most vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a complete lack of immunization 2.The significance of zero-dose children extends beyond the individual, as they represent communities that are often marginalized and deprived of multiple essential services 2. Globally, these children constitute a substantial proportion of the underimmunized population, accounting for over 70% of all children who have not received the full course of recommended vaccines 2. Reaching these zero-dose children is therefore paramount to achieving ambitious immunization coverage targets set for 2030 by global health organizations 2. Furthermore, the presence of zero-dose children underscores a fundamental challenge in public health efforts to ensure that no child is left behind in the provision of life-saving interventions 2.The context in which these challenges are being addressed is increasingly urban. The world is experiencing a significant shift towards urban living, with rapid urbanization trends observed globally, particularly in regions like Africa and Asia 5. Projections indicate that by 2050, nearly 70% of the world's population will reside in urban areas 12. This growth is particularly concentrated in megacities within the emerging world, further emphasizing the urban dimension of global health challenges 6. Given this massive demographic shift, the issues surrounding zero-dose children will increasingly be concentrated in urban settings. Understanding the specific dynamics of immunization in urban environments is therefore crucial for developing effective strategies to reach and protect all children 16. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current prevalence of zero-dose children with a focus on urban areas, examine the projected impact of urbanization on child immunization, investigate the contributing factors, explore future scenarios, and highlight existing and proposed interventions to address this critical public health concern.2. Current Prevalence of Zero-Dose Children Globally and in Urban Areas: An Analysis of Recent DataRecent data reveals that the number of zero-dose children worldwide remains alarmingly high. In 2022, approximately 14.3 million children had not received any routine vaccines 17, and this number slightly increased to 14.5 million in 2023 1. While there was a decrease from the 18.1 million zero-dose children recorded in 2021, the 2023 figure is still significantly higher than the 12.8 million reported in 2019, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 19. The pandemic caused substantial disruptions to health services globally, leading to a notable increase in the number of zero-dose children 19.The distribution of zero-dose children is not uniform across the globe. The majority of these children, approximately 87%, live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 2. Over half of the global total are concentrated in just seven countries: Nigeria, India, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Indonesia, and Yemen 20. Ten countries account for the largest numbers of zero-dose children, including Nigeria, India, Ethiopia, DRC, Sudan, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Angola, and Pakistan 18. These high numbers are particularly prevalent in the African and South-East Asian regions, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in these areas 23.Analyzing the prevalence in urban versus rural settings reveals important disparities. Children residing in rural areas are nearly twice as likely to be zero-dose compared to their urban counterparts 21. However, a significant proportion, roughly 40%, of zero-dose children live in settings categorized as urban, remote rural, and conflict-affected 2. Specifically, around a quarter of all zero-dose children are located in urban and peri-urban areas 3. This indicates that while rural areas face a higher prevalence, the substantial number of zero-dose children in urban environments necessitates focused attention within urban immunization strategies.Within urban areas, the "urban advantage" in vaccination coverage often does not extend to the poorest populations. Children living in poor urban areas face unique challenges that impact their access to life-saving vaccines, resulting in a higher prevalence of being zero-dose compared to the urban non-poor 3. Significant inequalities in immunization coverage exist within urban settings, with the urban poor often experiencing similar or even worse access barriers than rural populations 3. This highlights the critical need to address the specific vulnerabilities of the urban poor in immunization programs.To illustrate the global distribution of this challenge, the following table presents the number of zero-dose children and DTP1 coverage rates for several high-burden countries in 2023:
RankCountryNumber Zero-Dose Children (Millions)DTP1 Coverage (%)1Nigeria2.134892India1.592933Ethiopia0.917874Democratic Republic of Congo0.839865Sudan0.701-6Indonesia0.662937Yemen0.580-8Afghanistan0.467-9Angola0.411-10Pakistan0.39690
Note: Coverage data for Sudan, Yemen, and Angola was not readily available in the provided snippets for 2023.This data underscores the concentration of zero-dose children in specific countries, many of which are undergoing rapid urbanization, further emphasizing the need to understand and address the urban dimension of this issue.3. Projected Urbanization Trends and Their Potential Impact on Child ImmunizationThe global trend of urbanization is expected to continue at a rapid pace in the coming decades. The world's urban population is likely to keep increasing significantly 6, with an additional billion people projected to reside in cities between 2023 and 2035 6. By 2040, it is anticipated that nearly two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas 25, and this proportion is projected to reach 68% by 2050 7. This sustained and rapid urbanization will likely amplify the challenges associated with reaching zero-dose children in urban settings if proactive and well-designed measures are not implemented 25.The patterns of urban growth vary significantly across different regions. The majority of this growth is expected to occur in Asia and Africa 7. Africa, in particular, is projected to experience the most substantial increase in its urban population 5. Countries such as India, China, and Nigeria are anticipated to account for a significant portion of the overall global urban population growth 7. Notably, these are regions and countries that currently bear a high burden of zero-dose children. This convergence suggests that the existing vulnerabilities in their immunization systems will be further challenged by the increasing influx of people into urban areas, potentially leading to a greater number of underserved children in cities 25.Urbanization has the potential to improve overall access to healthcare, including immunization services, due to the concentration of facilities and personnel 28. However, rapid and often unplanned urbanization, particularly in LMICs, can place a significant strain on existing resources and infrastructure 9. This can lead to the growth of slums and peri-urban poor communities characterized by limited access to essential services, including immunization 9. While cities may offer a greater density of healthcare infrastructure compared to rural areas, the benefits of this infrastructure are not always equitably distributed, and marginalized urban populations may face severe limitations in accessing necessary health services 11.Furthermore, continued urbanization is expected to contribute to cities becoming major epicenters for the transmission of infectious diseases 14. The high population density characteristic of urban environments facilitates a greater potential for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) compared to rural areas 11. Higher concentrations of unvaccinated children in rapidly growing urban areas can therefore lead to an increased risk of outbreaks of VPDs, posing a threat not only to the zero-dose children themselves but also to the broader urban population 11.4. Factors Contributing to Zero-Dose Status in Urban Environments: Access to Healthcare, Socioeconomic Status, and Parental BeliefsSeveral interconnected factors contribute to the challenge of zero-dose children in urban environments. Access to healthcare, while generally perceived to be better in urban areas, often presents significant barriers for the urban poor. Physical distance to clinics can still be a factor, particularly for those living in sprawling peri-urban areas or lacking adequate transportation 33. Moreover, the quality of health services available in poor urban areas may be lower, further deterring utilization 3. A fundamental issue is the limited healthcare infrastructure specifically tailored to the needs of marginalized urban populations, including insufficient primary healthcare facilities and outreach services 31. The scheduling of vaccination sessions often poses another barrier, as they are typically conducted during working hours, making it difficult for caregivers with inflexible employment to attend 31. Additionally, opportunities to vaccinate children during routine visits for other health concerns are frequently missed, representing a significant lost chance for immunization 30.Socioeconomic status plays a critical role in determining a child's likelihood of being zero-dose in urban settings. Poverty is a major underlying factor, with a substantial proportion of zero-dose children residing in households with incomes below the poverty line 1. Financial constraints, including the direct costs of healthcare services and the indirect costs such as transportation, can prevent families from accessing immunization 32. Many urban poor individuals are engaged in informal employment with restrictive working conditions, making it challenging to take time off to seek vaccination for their children, often resulting in a loss of daily wages 31. Research indicates that a low socioeconomic position is a strong predictor of incomplete immunization among children in urban poor communities 39.Parental beliefs and awareness also significantly influence vaccination uptake in urban areas. A lack of awareness regarding the importance of immunization and the benefits it provides is a key contributing factor 33. Misinformation and rumors about vaccines can lead to a lack of trust in healthcare systems and contribute to vaccine hesitancy 32. This hesitancy may stem from concerns about potential side effects or a general distrust of public health authorities 42. Studies have consistently shown that low maternal education levels are strongly associated with a higher prevalence of zero-dose children, potentially due to limited access to information and lower health literacy 1. Cultural and religious beliefs within diverse urban populations can also play a role in parental decisions regarding vaccination 31.Beyond these primary factors, other elements contribute to the issue. The transient nature of populations in urban slums and the prevalence of seasonal migration make it difficult to ensure continuity of care and accurately estimate the target population for immunization programs 31. Gender inequality and a lack of autonomy for mothers in some urban settings can also hinder vaccination efforts 17. Additionally, stigma and discrimination faced by certain ethnic groups and undocumented migrants can impede their access to healthcare services, including immunization 35. Limited social support networks among the urban poor can further exacerbate these challenges 3.5. Analyzing the Impact of Future Urban Growth on Access to Vaccination Services for ChildrenThe projected rapid urban growth will likely place an even greater strain on existing healthcare infrastructure in cities, particularly in low-resource settings 6. As urban populations expand, the current capacity of healthcare facilities and the number of healthcare personnel may become increasingly inadequate to meet the growing demand for immunization services 31. This situation could be further compounded by the potential development of more informal settlements characterized by a lack of basic infrastructure, making it challenging to deliver outreach services and establish accessible vaccination points 9.Urbanization trends also suggest a continued growth in the number of people living in poverty within cities 9. This increase in urban poverty is likely to further entrench the socioeconomic barriers that already hinder access to vaccination for many children (as discussed in Section 4). Without targeted interventions specifically designed to address the needs of the urban poor, the concentration of poverty in urban areas could lead to a significant rise in the number of zero-dose children 1.The increasing diversity and complexity of urban environments will also have a significant impact on immunization programs. Cities are becoming more heterogeneous, with a greater mix of cultures, languages, and socioeconomic backgrounds, including a growing number of migrants and marginalized groups 31. Reaching mobile and transient populations, who may move frequently within or between cities, will become an even greater challenge 31. Effective immunization strategies will need to be culturally and linguistically appropriate to address the diverse needs of these urban populations 31.Despite these challenges, future urban growth also presents opportunities for innovation and improved reach. The higher population density in urban areas could potentially make certain immunization interventions more efficient and cost-effective compared to rural settings 30. Urban areas often serve as hubs for technological advancements, creating opportunities to leverage digital tools and innovative delivery models to enhance immunization programs (as will be discussed in Sections 6 and 7) 48. The presence of existing healthcare facilities and community networks within cities can also be strengthened and expanded to improve access to vaccination for underserved populations 30.6. Modeling and Projections of Zero-Dose Children in Urban Areas Based on Current Trends and Urbanization ForecastsResearch specifically focused on modeling or projecting the number of zero-dose children in urban areas based on urbanization forecasts appears to be limited in the available data 2. Existing data often aggregates urban areas, which can mask the significant inequalities and variations in immunization coverage that exist within cities, particularly between wealthier and poorer neighborhoods 39. This lack of precise urban-specific projections represents a notable gap in our understanding and highlights the need for further research in this area. Without detailed projections, it becomes more challenging to accurately plan and allocate resources for targeted urban immunization programs.However, the application of geospatial modeling techniques offers a promising avenue for improving our understanding of the distribution of zero-dose children within urban settings. These models can help to map the prevalence of zero-dose children and identify high-risk areas at a granular level 56. Geospatial analysis can reveal micro-level variations in vaccination coverage within urban areas that might be obscured when using more aggregated data 58. Furthermore, these models can be used to predict optimal locations for establishing additional vaccination sites or conducting outreach activities to reach underserved urban populations 56.Machine learning approaches also hold potential for predicting and understanding the factors associated with zero-dose children in urban environments 46. By analyzing large datasets that include socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related information, machine learning algorithms can identify key determinants of zero-dose status. This can help in developing predictive models that can be used to target interventions towards children who are most at risk of not receiving vaccinations 46. Factors such as maternal education, maternal employment, household wealth, and access to media have been identified as being significantly associated with a child's zero-dose status 46. The observed urban-rural divide in zero-dose prevalence 60 further underscores the need to consider the specific context of urban environments in these models. Future projections will need to account for the complex interplay between urbanization and these various socioeconomic and demographic factors to provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding of potential trends in the number of zero-dose children in urban areas.7. Existing and Proposed Initiatives and Strategies to Address Zero-Dose Children in Urban AreasSeveral global initiatives and strategies are currently in place or being proposed to tackle the issue of zero-dose children, with an increasing focus on urban settings. The World Health Organization's Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) has set an ambitious target of reducing the number of zero-dose children by 50% by the year 2030 2. Similarly, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has incorporated a comparable goal within its 5.0 Strategy 16. UNICEF has also developed an Immunization Roadmap that emphasizes reaching zero-dose children and communities with full vaccination, including those in fragile and humanitarian settings 11. These global frameworks recognize the particular challenges of reaching the most marginalized populations, which often include those residing in urban slums and other deprived urban areas 1.A key element of many successful and proposed strategies involves robust community engagement. This includes actively involving community leaders, such as religious and traditional figures, who often hold significant influence within their communities 31. Community health workers are also recognized as being crucial in outreach efforts, building trust with families, and providing essential information about vaccination 16. Effective communication requires tailoring messages to align with local cultural norms and beliefs 40. Some initiatives emphasize the importance of co-creating interventions in partnership with community members to ensure relevance and acceptance 40. Additionally, community mapping initiatives have been used to identify underserved areas and plan targeted vaccination activities 40.Strengthening and integrating vaccination services within existing healthcare systems is another critical strategy. This involves establishing clear referral systems between different health service providers 36. Tailoring the location and timing of vaccination services to better suit the needs of urban populations, such as offering services at community centers, markets, or places of worship, and extending clinic hours to include evenings and weekends, are also important approaches 31. Mobile vaccination strategies and the establishment of outreach posts in underserved urban areas have proven effective in increasing access 16.Leveraging technology and innovation is increasingly being recognized as a vital component of urban immunization strategies. Digital tools can be used for various purposes, including data collection, tracking children's vaccination status, sending reminders to caregivers, and managing vaccine supplies 48. The application of GIS mapping can help identify and visualize underserved areas within cities, allowing for more targeted interventions 34. Mobile health (mHealth) initiatives can also be utilized to disseminate information, schedule appointments, and follow up with families 35.Addressing vaccine hesitancy requires a multifaceted approach. Building confidence in vaccines and the healthcare system through trusted sources, including community leaders and healthcare workers, is essential 40. Countering misinformation through accurate education and tailored communication strategies is also crucial 40. Understanding the specific reasons behind vaccine hesitancy within different urban communities is necessary to develop effective and context-specific interventions 40.8. Challenges and Opportunities in Reaching and Vaccinating Children in Rapidly Growing Urban EnvironmentsReaching and vaccinating children in rapidly growing urban environments presents a complex set of challenges. One significant challenge is the lack of accurate and disaggregated data on urban populations, particularly within informal settlements and among migrant communities. This makes it difficult to identify and track zero-dose children and to plan effective immunization campaigns 2. The rapidly changing demographics of urban areas, including high rates of mobility and transient populations, further complicate efforts to ensure children receive the full course of vaccinations 31. Inadequate infrastructure in many urban slums and peri-urban areas, including limited access to healthcare facilities, clean water, and sanitation, also poses a substantial barrier to accessing immunization services 3.The logistical complexities of delivering immunization services in densely populated and often poorly mapped urban environments represent another significant hurdle 16. Social and cultural barriers, such as diverse cultural beliefs, language differences, and social fragmentation, can also impede vaccination efforts, requiring tailored approaches for different urban communities 31. In some urban settings, security concerns and violence may restrict access for both healthcare workers and families seeking immunization 34. Additionally, urban health programs often face competition for limited financial and human resources with other pressing urban development needs 35.Despite these considerable challenges, rapidly growing urban environments also offer unique opportunities for improving child immunization. The higher population density can facilitate more efficient and cost-effective delivery of services compared to sparsely populated rural areas 30. Technological advancements, particularly in digital health and mobile communications, can be leveraged to enhance data management, improve communication with caregivers, and support targeted interventions 48. The presence of existing healthcare facilities and community networks within cities provides a foundation that can be strengthened and expanded to reach more children 30. Engaging established community organizations and leaders can be an effective way to build trust and promote vaccination within urban communities 31. Furthermore, the interconnected nature of urban environments allows for potential intersectoral collaboration with other sectors such as education, social welfare, and urban planning to address the broader social determinants of zero-dose status 30. Finally, urban areas can serve as innovation hubs for developing and piloting new and more effective immunization strategies tailored to the specific needs of urban populations 51.9. Key Findings and Projections Regarding Zero-Dose Children in Urban Areas: Highlighting Significant Trends and Regional VariationsThe analysis of available data reveals several key findings regarding zero-dose children in urban areas. The number of zero-dose children globally remains high, and a significant proportion of these children reside in urban settings, particularly within impoverished urban slums. Urban poverty appears to exacerbate the risk of a child being zero-dose, often negating the generally observed "urban advantage" in access to healthcare services. The rapid pace of urbanization, especially in regions already facing a high burden of zero-dose children, presents both substantial challenges and potential opportunities for immunization programs. The factors that contribute to a child's zero-dose status in urban environments are multifaceted, encompassing issues related to healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and parental beliefs and awareness. While specific models and projections focused solely on urban zero-dose children are currently limited, the application of geospatial modeling and machine learning techniques offers promising tools for better understanding and predicting future trends in these populations. Numerous initiatives and strategies are being implemented and proposed to address this issue, with a growing emphasis on community engagement, strengthening health systems, and leveraging technological innovations. However, reaching and vaccinating children in rapidly growing urban environments remains a complex undertaking due to challenges such as data gaps, the mobility of urban populations, infrastructure limitations, and the social and cultural diversity of cities.Several significant trends emerge from the data. There has been a post-pandemic increase in the number of zero-dose children globally, and the recovery to pre-pandemic levels has been slow. There is a growing recognition within the public health community of the specific and often severe challenges faced by the urban poor in accessing routine immunization services. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in exploring and implementing technology-driven solutions and innovative strategies to improve urban immunization coverage. A greater emphasis is being placed on community-led approaches that involve local leaders and community health workers, as well as on fostering intersectoral collaboration to address the underlying social determinants that contribute to the zero-dose phenomenon.Regional variations in the prevalence and characteristics of urban zero-dose children are also notable. Africa and Asia currently bear the highest burden, and this is consistent with projections for future urbanization trends in these regions. The specific challenges encountered and the most effective strategies for intervention are likely to vary considerably across different urban contexts, depending on factors such as the size and density of the city, its socioeconomic profile, and the prevailing cultural and religious beliefs of its inhabitants. This underscores the importance of developing context-specific approaches rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all model for addressing urban immunization challenges.10. Conclusion and Recommendations for Future Interventions and ResearchAddressing the issue of zero-dose children in urban areas is of paramount importance for achieving global immunization goals and ensuring equitable health outcomes for all children. The continued rapid urbanization necessitates a focused and adaptive approach to immunization programming in cities. Based on the analysis, several recommendations can be made for future interventions and research.For future interventions, there is a critical need to invest in strengthening primary healthcare systems within urban poor areas, ensuring they are adequately resourced and accessible. Targeted outreach programs should be developed and implemented to specifically reach marginalized urban communities, taking into account their unique needs and challenges. Leveraging digital technologies offers significant potential for improving data collection, tracking vaccination status, and enhancing communication with caregivers. Strengthening community engagement efforts, by involving local leaders and community health workers, and developing culturally appropriate strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are also crucial. Promoting intersectoral collaboration with other relevant sectors can help to address the broader social determinants that contribute to a child being zero-dose. Finally, ensuring that vaccination service delivery models are flexible and convenient, catering to the diverse schedules and circumstances of urban residents, is essential for improving coverage.Future research should focus on developing more accurate models and projections of zero-dose children in urban areas, taking into account detailed urbanization trends and socioeconomic factors. In-depth studies are needed to better understand the specific barriers and drivers of zero-dose status in diverse urban contexts, including the experiences of migrant and other vulnerable populations. Rigorous evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various interventions targeting urban zero-dose children should be conducted to inform evidence-based programming. Furthermore, research should explore the potential impact of emerging challenges, such as climate change, on urban immunization programs and identify strategies to build resilience.In conclusion, a concerted and collaborative effort involving governments, international organizations, healthcare providers, communities, and researchers is essential to effectively address the complex challenge of zero-dose children in the face of rapid urbanization. By implementing targeted interventions, leveraging innovation, and continuing to build our understanding through research, we can strive towards a future where every child, regardless of their urban setting, has access to life-saving vaccines.
